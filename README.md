# Kilombino Bitcoin-Blake2b wallet

A Bitcoin wallet for Android for **both sides of the BLAKE2b fork at once**. Watch any
extended *public* key across the BLAKE2b chain and the classic SHA-256 chain side by
side, or create a spending wallet whose seed is generated on-device and never leaves it.

Built for GrapheneOS: no Google Play Services, no push server, no analytics, no
account. Apache-2.0, reproducible, and every line of cryptography is in this repo.

## What it does

- **Watch or spend.** Import an xpub to watch read-only, or create a spending (hot)
  wallet: its seed is generated on the phone — roll physical dice, SeedSigner-style, or
  use the secure RNG — and stored encrypted behind an Android Keystore key that needs
  your fingerprint or device PIN to sign. Native SegWit (bc1q) by default.
- **Both chains, one key.** BLAKE2b and SHA-256 share a genesis block and Bitcoin's
  whole address scheme — the fork changed the proof-of-work, not key derivation — so
  the same xpub is meaningful on both, and the balances diverge at the fork.
- **xpub, ypub or zpub.** Legacy, wrapped SegWit and native SegWit, detected from the
  SLIP-132 version bytes and explained in the UI.
- **Your own node.** The BLAKE2b side can point at any Electrum server you run.
- **Balance-change notifications** without a push server: the phone asks the Electrum
  server itself, on a visible foreground service you opt into.
- **It explains itself.** The scan is narrated — derivation paths tick past, and the
  gap limit is drawn as a ring that fills and resets — so you can watch how a wallet
  actually finds your coins instead of staring at a spinner.

## Default servers

| Chain | Server | Software |
|---|---|---|
| BLAKE2b | `fulcrum.kilombino.com:17717` | Fulcrum 2.1.2 |
| SHA-256 | `nobip110fulcrum.kilombino.com:50002` | Frigate 1.5.2 |

Both are TLS with **self-signed certificates**, which is normal for Electrum servers
and means CA validation would be meaningless. Instead the app pins: it remembers the
SHA-256 fingerprint it saw first, and if the certificate ever changes it says so and
refuses to continue until you accept the new one deliberately.

The SHA-256 side is a lookup service — find your coins with an xpub — so it does not
offer a custom node. The BLAKE2b side does.

## Security posture

**A watch-only wallet holds no secrets; a hot wallet holds exactly one.** Several
decisions follow:

- In watch-only mode there is no key to leak. In hot mode the only secret is the seed,
  encrypted with an Android Keystore key created with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`
  — the fingerprint/PIN is bound to the decryption cipher, not a screen the app could skip.
- The xpub lives in ordinary app-private storage, not `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
  Encrypting a non-secret would buy nothing but a dependency on
  `androidx.security:security-crypto`, which is both an alpha and deprecated.
  `allowBackup=false` keeps it off cloud backups; the app sandbox does the rest.
- An xpub **is** privacy-sensitive — it reveals every address you will ever use — and
  the app says so on the first screen.

## Cryptography

There is no crypto dependency in this project. No BouncyCastle, no bdk, no
secp256k1 JNI. All of it is Kotlin in `app/src/main/java/.../crypto/`:

| Piece | Why it is in-tree |
|---|---|
| `Secp256k1.kt` | secp256k1 curve arithmetic. `Ecdsa.kt` adds signing with RFC-6979 deterministic nonces (no reused/biased `k`), low-S, DER — pinned to the BIP-143 worked example so a wrong signature can never ship. Watch-only mode still touches only the public half. |
| `Ripemd160.kt` | Android ships no RIPEMD-160, and HASH160 needs it. ~120 lines of fully specified, deterministic code with published vectors. |
| `Base58.kt`, `Bech32.kt` | Small, exactly specified encodings. |
| `Bip32.kt` | Public derivation only — there is deliberately no CKDpriv. |

Correctness is pinned by `app/src/test/.../CryptoTest.kt`: the RIPEMD-160
specification vectors, the published BIP-49 and BIP-84 account vectors, and an
Electrum scripthash confirmed against both live servers.
